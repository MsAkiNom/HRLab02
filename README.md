# Software Quiality Lab 2

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/hallibay/HRLab02/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/hallibay/HRLab02?branch=main)

To demonstrate TDD and code coverage for our second software quality lab, we use the open source project, Hospital Run.      
We chose this system because it aligns perfectly with our topic which is, "Procurement Of Health Information System For 25 Primary Health Centers In Nigeria". All of our requirements in lab 1 are based on the features of this system.      

Hospital Run is a free software for developing world hospitals. If you're interested in visiting the original project, please click [here](https://github.com/HospitalRun/hospitalrun-frontend)
